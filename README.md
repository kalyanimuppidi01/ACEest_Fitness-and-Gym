# 🏋️ ACEst Fitness & Gym

This project is a **Flask + Tkinter Python application** for ACEst Fitness & Gym.
It demonstrates:

* **Flask development** for REST APIs
* **Tkinter GUI** for a desktop workout tracker
* **Version control** with Git/GitHub
* **Automated testing** with Pytest
* **Containerization** with Docker
* **CI/CD pipeline** using GitHub Actions + GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)

It also includes a **realistic HTML landing page (index.html)** to make the web app look like a professional gym website.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Flask web application with **gym management APIs**:

  * `/` → Realistic homepage (HTML UI with hero banner, sections, navigation)
  * `/members` → list of members
  * `/membership/<id>` → details of a specific member
  * `/workouts` → list of workout plans
  * `/trainers` → list of trainers
  * `/classes` → fitness class schedule
  * `/bmi?weight=70&height=1.75` → BMI calculator

* **JWT Authentication**:

  * `/login` → login with credentials to get JWT token
  * `/protected` → secured endpoint, requires valid token

* **Modern UI**:

  * Realistic landing page (`templates/index.html`) with sections for workouts, yoga, cardio
  * Navigation bar linking to API routes
  * Hero banner with call-to-action

* **Tkinter Desktop App**:

  * Integrated into `app.py`
  * Lets users log workouts (name + duration)
  * View all logged workouts in a popup window
  * Skipped automatically inside Docker (via `DOCKER_ENV`)

* **Automated Tests with Pytest**:

  * API endpoints (valid + invalid cases)
  * BMI calculator
  * JWT authentication flow
  * ✅ Tests also run **inside Docker builds** – if any test fails, the build fails

* **CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions**:

  * Runs tests automatically on every push/PR
  * Builds & publishes Docker image to **GHCR**

## ⚙️ Run Locally

### 1. Clone Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kalyanimuppidi01/ACEest_Fitness-and-Gym.git
cd ACEst-Fitness
```

### 2. Virtual Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
python app.py
```

This will:

* Start the **Flask API** at 👉 [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
* Open the **Tkinter Desktop App** window for workout tracking

---

## 🖥️ Tkinter GUI Usage

* Enter a workout name (e.g., `"Cardio"`) and duration (`30`).
* Click **Add Workout** → saved in memory.
* Click **View Workouts** → popup shows all logged workouts.

⚠️ Tkinter GUI runs only locally, **not inside Docker**.

---

## 🧪 Run Tests

Run tests locally:

```bash
pytest -v
```

✔️ Tests include:

* Members, workouts, trainers, classes
* Valid & invalid member lookup
* BMI calculator (valid & invalid inputs)
* JWT authentication (login success, login failure, protected access)

---

## 🐳 Run with Docker (Flask only)

### Build Image Locally

```bash
docker build -t aceest-fitness .
```

During build:

* Dependencies are installed
* ✅ **Pytest is executed automatically inside Docker**
* If any test fails → build fails

### Run the Container

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 aceest-fitness
```

Open 👉 [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

⚠️ Tkinter is skipped inside Docker (`DOCKER_ENV=1`).

---

## 📦 Run from GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)

This repo is set up with **GitHub Actions** to automatically build and publish a Docker image.

### Pull the Latest Image

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/kalyanimuppidi01/acest-fitness:latest
```

### Run the Container

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 ghcr.io/kalyanimuppidi01/acest-fitness:latest
```

---

## 🔐 JWT Authentication

### 1. Login to Get Token

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/login \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"username":"admin","password":"admin"}'
```

Response:

```json
{"access_token": "<your.jwt.token>"}
```

### 2. Access Protected Route

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/protected \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <your.jwt.token>"
```

Response:

```json
{"message": "Hello, admin. You are authorized!"}
```

## ⚡ CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

This project uses **GitHub Actions** for automated CI/CD.

### 🔄 Workflow Overview

The pipeline (`.github/workflows/main.yml`) runs on every **push** and **pull request** to `main`.

It has two stages:

1. **Build & Test (CI)**

   * Checkout code
   * Set up Python 3.10
   * Install dependencies
   * Run all tests with `pytest` (again inside CI)

2. **Docker Build & Push (CD)**

   * Runs only if tests pass
   * Builds Docker image (which itself re-runs pytest inside)
   * Pushes image to GHCR as:

     ```
     ghcr.io/kalyanimuppidi01/acest-fitness:latest
     ```

---

### 📊 Pipeline Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Push / PR to main] --> B[CI: Run Pytest in Actions]
    B -->|All tests pass| C[CD: Docker Build (with pytest inside)]
    C --> D[Push Image to GHCR]
    D --> E[Deploy/Run Container Anywhere]
```

---

### ✅ Benefits

* Ensures **code correctness** before packaging
* Guarantees **consistent container builds**
* Provides an **always-available Docker image** for deployment
* Secure authentication via **GitHub Actions secrets**
* Double safety:

  * Tests run in GitHub Actions (CI)
  * Tests also run inside Docker build
